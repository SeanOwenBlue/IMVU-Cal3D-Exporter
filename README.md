# IMVU Cal3D Exporter #
The script in this repository is my _attempt_ at replicating the functionalities of [this add-on](https://github.com/Wormnest/imvu_cal3d?tab=readme-ov-file#cal3d-blender-exporter-for-imvu-version-14) for Blender 5.0+.

## Installation (Blender Add-on) ##

- Open Blender.
- Go to Edit → Preferences → Add-ons.
- Click Install… (top-right).
- Select the downloaded ZIP file.
- Click Install Add-on.

- (Optional) Click Save Preferences so it stays enabled next time.

## Release Notes ##

### Version 1.5 (January 22, 2026) ###
- This version is called "1.5" because it aims to match the functionality of [this add-on](https://github.com/Wormnest/imvu_cal3d?tab=readme-ov-file#cal3d-blender-exporter-for-imvu-version-14) but for Blender 5.0+.
- An experimental "Scaling" feature was added to support pre-export scaling.
